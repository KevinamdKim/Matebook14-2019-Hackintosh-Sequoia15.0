Thanks to Apple's macOS <a href="https://github.com/acidanthera">Acidanthera</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg">OpenCore</a>    

It is mainly based on <a href="https://github.com/andrewlsa/Matebook14-2019-Hackintosh">andrewlsa's work</a>.
And the intel bluetooth works on the file from <a href="https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware/issues/486#issuecomment-2356055645">ecklf's work</a>.
The wireless nerwork only works on itlwm.kext + HeliPort now.
Plz don't use the Airportitlwm.kext from anywhere.
Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zxystd">@zxystd</a>.
